Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can structure the documentation in a GitHub README format for your Python script that automates filling and submitting a Google Form using Selenium WebDriver:

# Google Form Automation with Selenium WebDriver

This Python script automates the process of filling and submitting a Google Form using Selenium WebDriver.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Firefox browser (GeckoDriver)
- OAuth2 credentials (optional for secure authentication)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Download and configure GeckoDriver for Firefox:
   
   - Download GeckoDriver from [Mozilla's GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
   - Extract the executable file and place it in a directory accessible from your system PATH.

## Usage

1. Replace placeholders with actual OAuth2 credentials if using secure authentication.

2. Update `form_url` with the URL of your Google Form.

3. Modify `form_data` with the actual field names and values from your Google Form.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python google_form_automation.py
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure your Google account settings allow access to less secure apps if OAuth2 authentication is not used.
- Handle CAPTCHA challenges or verification prompts if encountered during automation.
- Customize `form_data` dictionary and selectors based on your Google Form's HTML structure.
